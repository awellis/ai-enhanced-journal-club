## How to read a research paper

When reading a research paper, it is recommended to follow the three-pass strategy:

### The Three-Pass Method

#### First Pass: The Bird's Eye View
**Time Investment:**

**Purpose:** Quick scan to grasp the paper's structure and main points

**Steps:**

- Read title, abstract, and introduction
- Read section and subsection headings
- Read conclusion
- Glance at references

**Outcome:** Answer the "five Cs":

- Category (type of paper)
- Context (relation to other work)
- Correctness (validity of assumptions)
- Contributions (main findings)
- Clarity (writing quality)

#### Second Pass: The Content Grasp
**Time Investment:** 

**Purpose:** Understand the paper's content without technical details

**Steps:**

- Read with greater attention, ignoring proofs
- Study figures, diagrams, and graphs carefully
- Mark important references for follow-up

**Outcome:** Ability to summarize the paper's main thrust with supporting evidence

**Note:** Suitable for papers relevant but not central to your research

#### Third Pass: Deep Understanding
**Time Investment:** 

**Purpose:** Complete comprehension and virtual replication

**Steps:**

- Attempt to virtually "re-implement" the paper
- Identify and challenge every assumption
- Think about alternative presentations
- Note ideas for future work

**Outcome:**
- Ability to reconstruct paper from memory
- Understanding of strengths and weaknesses
- Recognition of implicit assumptions
- Identification of missing citations
- Awareness of potential technical issues
