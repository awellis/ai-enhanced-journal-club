  abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of generative AI on software developer productivity by analyzing data from three randomized controlled trials conducted at Microsoft, Accenture, and an anonymous Fortune 100 electronics manufacturing company. These field experiments, which were run by the companies as part of their ordinary course of business, provided a randomly selected subset of developers with access to GitHub Copilot, an AI-based coding assistant that suggests intelligent code completions. Though each separate experiment is noisy, combined across all three experiments and 4,867 software developers, our analysis reveals a 26.08\% increase (SE: 10.3\%) in the number of completed tasks among developers using the AI tool. Notably, less experienced developers showed higher adoption rates and greater productivity gains.},

  abstract = {Superstitions are typically seen as inconsequential creations of irrational minds. Nevertheless, many people rely on superstitious thoughts and practices in their daily routines in order to gain good luck. To date, little is known about the consequences and potential benefits of such superstitions. The present research closes this gap by demonstrating performance benefits of superstitions and identifying their underlying psychological mechanisms.Specifically,Experiments 1 through 4 show that activating good-luck-related superstitions via a common saying or action (e.g., “break a leg,” keeping one’s fingers crossed) or a lucky charm improves subsequent performance in golfing, motor dexterity, memory, and anagram games. Furthermore, Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate that these performance benefits are produced by changes in perceived self-efficacy. Activating a superstition boosts participants’ confidence in mastering upcoming tasks, which in turn improves performance. Finally, Experiment 4 shows that increased task persistence constitutes one means by which self-efficacy, enhanced by superstition, improves performance.},

Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

  abstract = {Human feedback is commonly utilized to finetune AI assistants. But human feedback may also encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful ones, a behaviour known as sycophancy. We investigate the prevalence of sycophancy in models whose finetuning procedure made use of human feedback, and the potential role of human preference judgments in such behavior. We first demonstrate that five state-of-the-art AI assistants consistently exhibit sycophancy across four varied free-form text-generation tasks. To understand if human preferences drive this broadly observed behavior, we analyze existing human preference data. We find that when a response matches a user's views, it is more likely to be preferred. Moreover, both humans and preference models (PMs) prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. Optimizing model outputs against PMs also sometimes sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy. Overall, our results indicate that sycophancy is a general behavior of state-of-the-art AI assistants, likely driven in part by human preference judgments favoring sycophantic responses.},

  abstract = {Uptake of AI tools in knowledge production processes is rapidly growing. Here, we explore the ability of generative AI tools to reliably extract qualitative data from peer-reviewed documents. Specifically, we evaluate the capacity of multiple AI tools to analyse literature and extract relevant information for a systematic literature review, comparing the results to those of human reviewers. We address how well AI tools can discern the presence of relevant contextual data, whether the outputs of AI tools are comparable to human extractions, and whether the difficulty of question influences the performance of the extraction. While the AI tools we tested (GPT4-Turbo and Elicit) were not reliable in discerning the presence or absence of contextual data, at least one of the AI tools consistently returned responses that were on par with human reviewers. These results highlight the utility of AI tools in the extraction phase of evidence synthesis for supporting human-led reviews and underscore the ongoing need for human oversight.},
